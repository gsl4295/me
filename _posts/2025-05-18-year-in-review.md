A "year in review" means that I am going to recap everything notable that happened.
For this, I'm starting from the first day of summer last year all the way to the last day of school this year.

### Travels
Before I start going deeper into classwork and stuff, I need to take a moment to appreciate how much I was able to travel last year.
- BPA Student Leadership Summit
  - Washington, DC
  - Lasted five days, and it happened to start on my birthday! (Late September)
  - Five-day trip, and we went early to see all the museums before the conference started.
- All the band trips.
  - No seriously, I think I was on a bus for 25 hours just for marching band season.
  - So much fun until someone decides to bring a speaker on the bus and blast the annoying song "Fein x Carnival"
- BPA State Leadership Conference
  - Tulsa, OK
  - This was so much fun. I got to travel to Tulsa with some of my fellow chapter officers and help one of them
  campaign for State Office. 
  - Not only that, but I also won some awards of my own, as you'll see in [my resume](https://gsl4295.github.io/me/resume).
- BPA Nationals
  - Orlando (and Cape Canaveral), FL
  - I can't lie, this was way more fun than State. No offense to my officer team, but the trip being just 3 of us was amazing.
  - It allowed me to not just see another Space Shuttle, but actually mark things off my bucket list.
    - I saw a rocket launch for the first time in my life, and I think everyone needs to before they die.
    - Next up is to see Starship and Super Heavy both land back at the launch towers.
  - And again, we came back with some awards for me and my chapter.<br>

I think it's fairly safe to say that I travelled a good amount last year. It was so much fun!
And the fact that I didn't even mention all the other BPA things that happened is scary...
I spent so much time on it.<br>

### Hobbies
I watched the Starship program closer than ever. From IFT-5's incredible catch to the RUDs of Flight 7 & 8, we were there
no matter if the launch was at 7:00am or 4:00pm. I witnessed some of the most incredible engineering marvels live.<br>
Other than that, I finally decided to pick up coding again, starting with an idea that I had 2 years before.
