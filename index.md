Hello! My name is Gibson. This is a little website that I made with the help of [myoldmopar's repo](https://github.com/myoldmopar/cv/tree/gh-pages).<br>
I'm generally fairly invested in learning about coding and computers, but I don't spend a ton of time on it.<br>
Right now I'm planning to go to college at Oklahoma State University as you'll find in [my school page](https://gsl4295.github.io/Website/school).<br>
My full resume (updated quite often!) is [here](https://gsl4295.github.io/me/resume)
