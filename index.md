*Hello! My name is Gibson. This is a website that I made with the inspiration of [myoldmopar's repo](https://github.com/myoldmopar/cv/tree/gh-pages).<br>
I'm fairly invested in learning about coding and computers, but [this isn't my whole life](https://gsl4295.github.io/me/interests)!<br>
Right now I'm planning to go to college at Oklahoma State University - as you'll find in [my school page](https://gsl4295.github.io/me/school).<br>
My full resume, which (right now) is mainly used for college applications, is [here](https://gsl4295.github.io/me/resume).*
