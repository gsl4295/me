### Music
I absolutely **love** playing the marimba. [Take a look!](https://youtu.be/pwYNXiK0-gs?si=JDWkTTHucB8UFMpx) (I'm the person playing 4 mallets) 
And I'm alright at the snare drum - barely good enough to play in the high school marching band.<br>
The music I listen to, however, is not so simple to explain.<br>
One moment (probably in the car or something), I'll listen to rap music or something a little energetic. 
Then the next moment (doing something that requires concentration), I'm listening to video game soundtracks.
My most played artists are definitely Kendrick Lamar and Tyler, The Creator... 
but Lena Raine and Nobuo Uematsu somehow both sneak in there too.<br>
**My playlists are pure CHAOS.**

### Computers
I'm currently developing code for a microcontroller vertically attached to my bulletin board with 5 clear push pins (see [PicoLaunchTimer](https://github.com/gsl4295/PicoLaunchTimer)).<br>
Back in the summer of my freshman year of high school, I saved up my money and built a mid-range desktop computer. 
I kid you not, it hasn't faltered whatsoever. I don't know what magic I was using in 9th grade.<br>
Generally, I like video games, but nothing too crazy. I play pretty much nothing but single-player games like Minecraft and Celeste,
then occasionally I'll get on Rocket League or Trackmania to do some online stuff.

### Other
I've been paying decently close attention to the Starship program since SN5's 150m hop test back in 2020, along with the Demo-2 mission carrying Bob and Doug.
Nowadays, I'm just praying that S35 doesn't die like its ancestors did.<br>
I (along with [myoldmopar](https://github.com/myoldmopar)) launch my own small rockets.
