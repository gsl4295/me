### Music
I absolutely **love** playing the marimba. [Take a look!](https://youtu.be/pwYNXiK0-gs?si=JDWkTTHucB8UFMpx) (I'm the person playing 4 mallets). <br>
And I'm alright at the snare drum... good enough to play in the high school marching band.<br>
The music I listen to, however, is not so organized.<br>
One moment (probably in the car or something), I'll listen to rap music or something a little energetic.<br>
Then the next moment (doing something that requires concentration), I'm listening to video game soundtracks.<br>
My most played artists are definitely Kendrick Lamar and Tyler, The Creator, but Lena Raine sneaks in there too.<br>
**My playlists are pure CHAOS.**

### Computers
I'm currently developing code for a microcontroller attached to my wall with 3 clear push pins (see [PicoLaunchTimer](https://github.com/gsl4295/PicoLaunchTimer))<br>
Back in the summer of my freshman year of high school, I saved up my money and built a mid-range desktop computer.<br>
I kid you not, it hasn't faltered whatsoever. I don't know what magic I was using in 9th grade.

### Rockets
I've been paying decently close attention to the Starship program since SN5's 150m hop test back in 2020, along with the Demo-2 mission carrying Bob and Doug.
Nowadays, I'm just praying that S35 doesn't die like its ancestors did.
