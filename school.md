*I'm a senior in high school right now and I'm planning some things for my future.<br>

If you're here to see my achievements in school, try checking [my resume](https://gsl4295.github.io/me/resume)!*

### High School
I've had a lot of fun making friends in high school, but I'm also inevitably ready to leave!
It's exhausting, but also comforting, knowing I'm likely through my hardest year.

### Concurrent
I'm simultaneously taking a few college credits at a local community college while I do normal high school.
It's really nice, since for every single class, it's less than $100 *without* scholarships.

### Undergraduate
Starting in Fall 2026, I'm going to pursue Aerospace Engineering with a minor in American Sign Language.<br>
*Find out "why aerospace? (or sign language?)" in [my interests page](https://gsl4295.github.io/me/interests).*

### Graduate
Yes, separating "undergraduate" from "graduate" does imply the existence of both, so yes.
It's pretty likely that I'm going to pursue at least a master's degree in aerospace engineering.<br>
*A doctorate is not (and should not be) in my mind right now.*
