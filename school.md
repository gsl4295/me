## Education
*I'm a senior in high school right now and I'm planning some things for my future:*<br>
*If you're here to see my achievements in school, try checking [my resume](https://gsl4295.github.io/me/resume)!*

### High School
I've had a lot of fun making friends in high school, but I'm also inevitably ready to leave!<br>
During this next year, I expect to be focusing much more on things like learning coding.

### Concurrent
I'm simultaneously taking a few college credits at a local community college while I do normal high school.<br>
It's really nice, since for every single class, it's less than $100 *without* scholarships.

### University
Starting in Fall 2026, I'm going to pursue Aerospace Engineering with a minor in American Sign Language.<br>
